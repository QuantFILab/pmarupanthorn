summary: This study evaluates the impact of ESG sustainability factors on U.S. equity indices using various factor models. The analysis focuses on Morningstar's U.S. market and sustainability indices from 2013 to 2022, excluding the COVID-19 period. The study employs three types of models: a standard factor model, a time series factor model, and a functional factor model. The standard factor model assesses the instantaneous effect of ESG factors on index returns, revealing that sustainability indices effectively mitigate ESG-related risks, while traditional U.S. indices are more sensitive to these factors. The time series factor model investigates the time-lagging effects of ESG factors, showing that sustainability indices exhibit a stronger correlation with ESG factors over time, especially in the short term. Finally, the functional factor model explores the dynamic and cumulative effects of ESG factors, highlighting their significant impact on sustainability indices compared to traditional indices.
